# Echo Escape

Echo Escape is a 2D Unity game where players control a dolphin lost in a dark underwater cave. Using echolocation, players must navigate, avoid obstacles, bounce off surfaces, and wander through the environment to find their way out.

This project was created for EGD 220: Game Studio I (Spring 2026) and is based on the core verbs:

- Avoid  
- Bounce  
- Wander

## Game Concept

In Echo Escape, visibility is limited. Instead of traditional lighting, players rely on echolocation pulses to reveal their surroundings. Sound waves bounce off cave walls and objects, briefly showing the environment and helping guide movement.

The game emphasizes:

- Exploration in darkness  
- Spatial awareness through sound  
- Careful navigation and timing
